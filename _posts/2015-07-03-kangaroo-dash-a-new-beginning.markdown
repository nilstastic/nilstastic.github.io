So, I've decided to make a game. Now, I don't mean one of those games that you scrap once you reach the part of the development cycle where you go *"yeah, this would be an awesome game, but I've learned so much and with all this new knowledge my next game is going to be even better!"*.

I'm talking about a real game, with a beginning, a middle and an end. And a main menu that will blow your mind.

### What's the game about?
The idea is to take my [VR jam entry](/oculus_rift/2015/06/03/kangaroo-dash-a-retrospective/) and expand and explore everything I liked about it. The main gameplay will stay the same, so you are still going to be avoiding lasers, rocks and other traps while jumping around (like a madman) in your living room, but there is a few things that were cut from the jam game that I'd really want people to see.

On the technical side of things - I'm currently rewriting a lot of the jam code to better fit a long term commitment. A lot of the physics is being replaced by trusty old tweens and everything is getting a performance tuning. In the jam I had to remove add a lot of the particle effects but I do hope that keeping a close eye on performance will remedy this.

### When will it be released?
I'm looking for a September or October release, but since I've heard that being approved to the store may take some time (or âˆž) it might be a tad optimistic. Development should be done in August but hopefully the approval process can be initiated before then.

### Will it be free?
One of the things that really grinds my gears are statements like *"it only contains 2 hours of gameplay, it should be free!"* - or people spending hours to pirate a mobile game instead of just buying it for $1.99. If you can afford the phone (and in this case a VR headset), you can afford the game.

I feel that paying for something is a way to make sure the developer get the encouragement he or she needs to continue creating games. So, it won't be free - but it'll not cost more than a Swedish ice cream. =)
