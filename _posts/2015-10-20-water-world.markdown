Since <a href="http://www.twitter.com/nilstastic" target="_blank">@nilstastic</a> decided to finish the game after the VR jam I have helped out with stuff like level design and that has been great fun, but now when the game soon is to be launched it starts to feel a bit scary. My favorite part in the jam version of Kangaroo dash was the rapids at the end so I wanted to make a water island, which resulted in what we call the "water world". The world is made up with a lot of water, traps and jumping between logs and I really hope you will enjoy it, I had great fun building it.
