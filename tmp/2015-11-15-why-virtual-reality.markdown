att man pratktiskt kan göra saker som är farligt på ett kostnadseffektivt sätt


While compiling a list of areas that will be affected by virtual reality I got stuck. Now, I didn't get stuck because I ran out of ideas - the problem was that the first item on the list was education. In this area there's simply no end to the possibilities that VR will bring to the table, so let's see if we fit virtual reality into all areas of the ..

Vart står vi nu, vilka headsets och vad finns tillgänglit. Vad krävs, vad kostar det.

### History
History lessons will be transformed from studying historical events to actually being there. With the help of 360 video students will be able stand with the dinosaurs during the extiction events and they will watch the gladiators battle it out in the Colosseum. In more recent history they will be able to experience what it is like living in one of the many concentration camps during the second world war.

It feels like we’ve been working on our game Kangaroo Dash forever, but it actually got started with the 2015 VR Jam in April this year. Since then the game has evolved into something we are really proud of, it has four different worlds with varying difficulty levels and we really hope that everyone will find it as fun and immersive as we do. We have finally submitted the game and it is currently under review by Oculus, and if everything goes well Kangaroo Dash will hit the GearVR store in the near future..

So far the game have managed to get some attention. During the jam there was an awesome gameplay video created by Selzier where he was playing and jumping through the game, we also got a <a href="http://www.vrpill.com/oculus-mobile-vr-jam-impressions/mobile-vr-jam-kangaroo-dash-impressions/" target="_blank">very nice review from VRPill</a>.  On Oculus Connect 2 the game was played by no other then Palmer Luckey - which of course was captured on video.
